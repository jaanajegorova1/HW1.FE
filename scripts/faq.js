Alpine Bus Journeys are your comfy seat with panoramic windows to breathtaking mountain vistas, charming villages, and air so fresh it might make you yodel (please don't, unless you're outside). It's transportation with a side of unparalleled scenery (and maybe a hairpin turn).`,

        content: `Generally, you'll find comfy standard seats (great views, great value, maybe great new friends) and perhaps slightly better seats with extra legroom. All offer a front-row seat to the greatest show on Earth â€“ the Alps!`,

        content: `Sometimes it's the weather (snow happens!), sometimes a sudden flock of particularly slow-moving sheep on the road, and sometimes the driver just had to stop for a photo of that view. Or maybe they got stuck behind a tractor. Welcome to "Mountain Road Time"!`,
